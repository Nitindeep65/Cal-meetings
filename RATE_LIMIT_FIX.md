# Gemini API Rate Limit Fix

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The application was encountering 429 "Too Many Requests" errors when calling the Gemini API, causing the calendar stats and insights features to fail.

**Error Details**:
```
status: 429,
statusText: 'Too Many Requests',
errorDetails: [Array]
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
- Created `generateContentWithRetry()` method that automatically retries failed API calls
- Implements exponential backoff strategy: 2s, 4s, 8s delays between retries
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts before giving up

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling** 
- Specifically detects rate limit errors (status 429)
- Provides informative logging for debugging
- Gracefully handles other API errors without unnecessary retries

### 3. **Applied to All Gemini API Calls**
Updated these methods to use the retry mechanism:
- `summarizeMeeting()` - Meeting summaries and insights
- `generateMeetingInsights()` - Calendar statistics and trends  
- `suggestMeetingImprovements()` - Meeting preparation suggestions

### 4. **Maintained Type Safety**
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Proper error type handling without using `any`
- Build passes successfully with no warnings

## How It Works

```typescript
// Before (prone to rate limits)
const result = await this.model.generateContent(prompt);

// After (with retry logic)
const result = await this.generateContentWithRetry(prompt);
```

The retry method:
1. Attempts the API call
2. If it fails with 429 error, waits with exponential backoff
3. Retries up to 3 times total
4. If all retries fail, throws the original error

## Benefits

- **üõ°Ô∏è Resilient**: Automatically handles temporary rate limits
- **üìä Reliable**: Calendar insights and AI features work consistently  
- **‚ö° Efficient**: Only retries when necessary (rate limits)
- **üîß Maintainable**: Centralized retry logic for all API calls

Your calendar app with Gemini AI integration is now much more robust and will handle API rate limits gracefully! üéâ
